You are doing a research paper on the famous Collatz Conjecture. In your experiment, you start off with an integer x, and you do the following procedure k times: 

  If x is even, divide x by 2. 

 Otherwise, set x to 3\cdot x+1. 

For example, starting off with 21 and doing the procedure 5 times, you get 21\rightarrow64\rightarrow32\rightarrow16\rightarrow8\rightarrow4.

After all k iterations, you are left with the final value of x. Unfortunately, you forgot the initial value. Please output any possible initial value of x.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 400). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains two integers k and x (1 \leq k,x \leq 20).

Output:
For each test case, print any possible initial value on a new line. It can be shown that the answer always exists.

Example:
Input:
3

1 4

1 5

5 4

Output:
1
10
21

Note:
In the first test case, since 1 is odd, performing the procedure k=1 times results in 1\cdot3+1=4, so 1 is a valid output.

In the second test case, since 10 is even, performing the procedure k=1 times results in \frac{10}{2}=5, so 10 is a valid output.

The third test case is explained in the statement.
