You are given an array of n non-negative integers [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n].

Your task is to cut it into three non-empty parts: a prefix, a middle part, and a suffix. Formally, you need to choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l < r < n, and obtain three parts:

  the prefix up the element at index l inclusive (i.e., [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_l]); 

 the central part from the element at index l+1 to the element at index r inclusive (i.e., [a_{l+1}, a_{l+2}, \dots, a_r]); 

 the suffix from the element at index r+1 to n inclusive (i.e., [a_{r+1}, a_{r+2}, \dots, a_n]). 

Let s_1, s_2, s_3 be the remainders of the sums of these parts modulo 3. In other words:

  s_1 = (\sum\limits_{i=1}^{l} a_i) \bmod 3; 

 s_2 = (\sum\limits_{i=l+1}^{r} a_i) \bmod 3; 

 s_3 = (\sum\limits_{i=r+1}^{n} a_i) \bmod 3. 

Your task is to find such boundaries l and r that either all numbers s_1, s_2, s_3 are different, or all numbers s_1, s_2, s_3 are the same.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  the first line contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 40); 

 the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 40). 

Output:
For each test case, if a suitable pair of integers l and r (1 \le l < r < n) exists, output these two integers (if there are multiple suitable pairs, you can output any of them). Otherwise, output two integers equal to 0.

Example:
Input:
4

6

1 2 3 4 5 6

4

1 3 3 7

3

2 1 0

5

7 2 6 2 4

Output:
3 5
0 0
1 2
2 4

Note:
Consider the examples from the statement:

  in the first example, the array is cut into parts [1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]; s_1 = s_2 = s_3 = 0; 

 in the second example, there is no suitable cut; 

 in the third example, the array is cut into parts [2], [1], [0]; s_1 = 2, s_2 = 1, s_3 = 0; 

 in the fourth example, the array is cut into parts [7, 2], [6, 2], [4]; s_1 = 0, s_2 = 2, s_3 = 1.
