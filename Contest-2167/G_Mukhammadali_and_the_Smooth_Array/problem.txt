Muhammadali has an integer array a_1,\dots,a_n. He can change (replace) any subset of positions; changing position i costs c_i and replaces a_i with any integer of his choice. The positions that he does not change must retain their original values.

After all changes, we call an index i (1 \le i  \lt  n) a drop if the final value at position i is strictly greater than the final value at position i+1. Muhammadali wants the final array to contain no drops.

Find the minimum cost of changes required to ensure that there are no drops in the array.

Input:
The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 5000) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 8000) — the length of the arrays.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) — the elements of the array.

The third line contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le 10^9) — the costs of changes.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 8000.

Output:
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible total cost required to eliminate all drops.

Note:
In the first and second examples, the array already has no drops, so no changes are needed.

In the third example, one of the optimal arrays is: [2,3,5,6]; to achieve this, all elements except the second need to be replaced, so the answer is c_1 + c_3 + c_4 = 3.
