khba is writing his girlfriend's name. He has n cubes, each with one lowercase Latin letter written on it. They are arranged in a row, forming a string s. His girlfriend's name is also a string t, consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.

To prove his love, he must check whether it is possible to rearrange the letters of string s so that it becomes her name t.

Input:
The first line contains an integer q (1 \le q \le 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20).

The second line of each test case contains two distinct strings s and t, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.

Output:
For each test case, output "YES" if the letters of s can be arranged to form t; otherwise, output "NO". 

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

Example:
Input:

humitsa mitsuha

4

orhi hori

6

aakima makima

6

nezuqo nezuko

6

misaka mikasa

Output:
YES

YES

NO

NO

YES

Note:
In the first example, the initial string is "humitsa", and the following operations can be performed: 

  swap the first and third characters, resulting in "muhitsa" 

 swap the second and fourth characters, resulting in "mihutsa" 

 swap the third and fifth characters, resulting in "mithusa" 

 swap the fourth and sixth characters, resulting in "mitsuha" 

In the second example, the initial string is "orhi", and the following operations can be performed: 

  swap the second and third characters, resulting in "ohri" 

 swap the first and second characters, resulting in "hori"
