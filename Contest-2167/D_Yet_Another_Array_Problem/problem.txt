You are given an integer n and an array a of length n. 

Find the smallest integer x (2 \le x \le 10^{18}) such that there exists an index i (1 \le i \le n) with \gcd^{\text{∗}}(a_i, x) = 1. If no such x exists within the range [2,10^{18}], output -1.^{\text{∗}}\gcd(x, y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y. 

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) — the number of test cases.

Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines:

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^{5}) — the length of the array.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^{18}).

It is guaranteed that the total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^{5}.

Output:
For each test case, output a single integer: the smallest x (2 \le x \le 10^{18}) such that there exists an index i with \gcd(a_i, x) = 1. If there is no such x in the range [2,10^{18}], print -1.

Example:

6 6 12 12

2 4 6 10

Output:
2

5

3

Note:
In the first test case, \gcd(2,1)=1, which is the smallest number satisfying the condition.

In the second test case: 

  \gcd(2,6)=2, \gcd(2,12)=2, so 2 cannot be the answer. 

 \gcd(3,6)=3, \gcd(3,12)=3, so 3 cannot be the answer. 

 \gcd(4,6)=2, \gcd(4,12)=4, so 4 cannot be the answer. 

 \gcd(5,6)=1, so the answer is 5. 

In the third test case: 

  \gcd(2,24)=2, \gcd(2,120)=2, \gcd(2,210)=2, so 2 cannot be the answer. 

 \gcd(3,24)=3, \gcd(3,120)=3, \gcd(3,210)=3, so 3 cannot be the answer. 

 \gcd(4,24)=4, \gcd(4,120)=4, \gcd(4,210)=2, so 4 cannot be the answer. 

 \gcd(5,24)=1, so the answer is 5. 

In the fourth test case: 

  \gcd(2,2)=2, \gcd(2,4)=2, \gcd(2,6)=2, \gcd(2,10)=2, so 2 cannot be the answer. 

 \gcd(3,2)=1, so the answer is 3$$$.
