Given an array c, let f(c) be the number of distinct elements in c. For example, f([1,2,2])=2 because there are two distinct elements in [1,2,2]: 1 and 2. Also, define c[i,j] as the subarray^{\text{∗}} of c bounded by positions i and j (that is, the array [c_i,c_{i+1},\ldots,c_j]).

There is an array a of size n. An array b of n elements is constructed such that b_i=f(a[1,i])+f(a[2,i])+\ldots+f(a[i,i]). You are given the array b. Find any possible a with elements 1 \leq a_i \leq n. It is guaranteed that at least one possible a exists.^{\text{∗}}An array x is a subarray of an array y if x can be obtained from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. 

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 10^5) – the number of elements in a and b.

The second line of each test case contains n integers b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^{18}).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output:
For each test case, print any possible a on a new line. The array a should satisfy 1\leq a_i\leq n.

For every test case, it is guaranteed at least one a that satisfies the conditions exists.

Example:
Input:
4

3

1 3 6

3

1 3 5

3

1 3 4

4

1 2 3 7

Output:
1 3 2
2 3 2
3 2 2
4 4 4 1

Note:
Let's verify our output for the second test case is correct: 

  b_1=f([2])=1 

 b_2=f([2,3])+f([3])=2+1=3 

 b_3=f([2,3,2])+f([3,2])+f([2])=2+2+1=5
