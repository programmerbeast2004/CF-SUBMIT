You are given an array of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. 

The value of an array is the sum of the maximums of each prefix of the array. More formally, the value of an array a is \sum_{i=1}^{n} \operatorname{max}(a_1, \ldots, a_i). For example, the value of the array [1, 2, 1] is \operatorname{max}(1) + \operatorname{max}(1, 2) + \operatorname{max}(1, 2, 1) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

You can choose two indices i and j and swap elements a_i and a_j; this operation can be applied at most one time.

Find the maximum possible value of the array a after at most one operation.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4) — the array a.

Output:
For each test case, output the maximum possible value of the array a after the swap has been performed.

Example:
Input:
4

5

2 1 4 5 3

2

5 1

3

3 2 1

2

6 7

Output:
25

10

9

14

Note:
For the first test case, we can swap a_1 with a_4 to get the array [5, 1, 4, 2, 3], which has a value of \operatorname{max}(5) + \operatorname{max}(5, 1) + \operatorname{max}(5, 1, 4) + \operatorname{max}(5, 1, 4, 2) + \operatorname{max}(5, 1, 4, 2, 3) = 25.

For the second test case, the current value of the array is \operatorname{max}(5) + \operatorname{max}(5, 1) = 10. If we were to swap a_1 and a_2, a would be equal to [1, 5], which has a value of \operatorname{max}(1) + \operatorname{max}(1, 5) = 6, meaning the best option is to not perform a swap.
