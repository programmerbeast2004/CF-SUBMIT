You are given a permutation a of length n^{\text{∗}}.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

  Select an index i (1 \le i \le \frac{n}{2}), and swap a_i and a_{2i}. 

For example, when a=[1,4,2,3,5], you can swap a_2 and a_4 to make it [1,3,2,4,5], but you cannot swap a_2 and a_3.

Please determine if the sequence a can be sorted in increasing order.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array). 

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains n distinct integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le n).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

Output:
If a can be sorted in increasing order, output "YES" on a separate line. Otherwise, output "NO" on a separate line.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will also be recognized as positive responses.

Example:
Input:
2

5

1 4 3 2 5

5

1 4 2 3 5

Output:
YES

NO

Note:
In the first test case, a is [1,4,3,2,5]. You can sort a in increasing order by swapping a_2 and a_4. Therefore, the answer is "YES".

In the second test case, a is [1,4,2,3,5]. It is impossible to sort a$$$ in increasing order. Therefore, the answer is "NO".
