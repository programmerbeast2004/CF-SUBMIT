Consider the following cube D where numbers x and 7-x lie on opposite sides:

    Image generated by Nano Banana Pro. A sequence b of integers from 1 to 6 is called a dice roll sequence if it satisfies the following condition:

  All pairs of adjacent elements lie on adjacent^{\text{∗}} sides of the cube. 

For example, [1,4,2] is a dice roll sequence, while [3,4,6,3] is not because 3 and 4 are not on adjacent sides of the dice. Additionally, [2,2,4] is not a dice roll sequence because 2 and 2 are on the same (not adjacent) side of the dice.

Given a sequence a of n integers from 1 to 6, you can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).

  Select an index 1 \le i \le n and an integer 1 \le x \le 6. Then, change the value of a_i to x. 

Please determine the minimum number of operations required to make a a dice roll sequence.^{\text{∗}}Two sides of the cube S and T are called adjacent if they share exactly one edge of the cube. Do note that this condition implies S \neq T as well.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 6).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

Output:
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to make a a dice roll sequence.

Example:
Input:
3

3

1 4 2

4

3 4 6 3

10

6 1 4 3 1 3 2 5 4 4

Output:
0

1

4

Note:
For the first test case, the sequence a is [1,4,2]. As this is already a dice roll sequence, the answer is 0.

For the second test case, the sequence a is [3,4,6,3].

Changing exactly one element, you can get [3,\color{red}{5},6,3], which is a dice roll sequence.

For the third test case, the sequence a is [6,1,4,3,1,3,2,5,4,4].

Changing exactly 4 elements, you can get [\color{red}{5},1,4,\color{red}{2},1,3,2,\color{red}{1},\color{red}{5},4], which is a dice roll sequence.
