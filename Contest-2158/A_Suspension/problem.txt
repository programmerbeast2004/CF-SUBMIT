A game is being played which initially consists of n players. On fouls, the referee is allowed to award yellow and red cards. The total number of yellow cards y and red cards r awarded to players is known for the game.

There are 2 ways a player can be suspended: 

  Receiving a red card. 

 Receiving 2 yellow cards. 

Once a player is suspended, they are removed from the game and can't receive any more cards. Determine the maximum number of players suspended from the game possible.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 500). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 100).

The second line of each test case contains two integers y and r (0 \le r \le n, 0 \le y + r \le 2n).

Output:
For each test case, print one line containing a single integer — denoting the maximum number of players suspended from the game possible.

Example:
Input:
5

3

1 2

2

0 0

4

6 0

3

3 3

10

11 5

Output:
2

0

3

3

10

Note:
For the first test case: 

  One of the possible ways to achieve maximum: Player 2 receives a red card, Player 3 receives a yellow card followed by a red card. 

 This way Player 2 and 3 are suspended. 

For the second test case: 

  No cards are awarded at all, so no one is suspended. 

For the third test case: 

  One of the possible ways to achieve maximum: Player 1 receives 2 yellow cards, Player 2 receives 2 yellow cards, and Player 4 receives 2 yellow cards. 

 This way Player 1, 2, and 4 are suspended.
